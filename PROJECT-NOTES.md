## üîå API Routes (MVP)

```
# Recipe Management
GET    /api/recipes              # Get all user recipes
POST   /api/recipes              # Create new recipe
GET    /api/recipes/:id          # Get specific recipe
PUT    /api/recipes/:id          # Update recipe

PUT    /api/meal-plans/:id       # Update meal plan

# Shopping Lists
GET    /api/meal-plans/:id/shopping-list  # Generate shopping list from meal plan
```

## üì± Key Pages/Routes

1. **Dashboard** (`/`) - Recipe overview + quick actions
2. **Recipes** (`/recipes`) - Browse/manage all recipes
3. **Recipe Detail** (`/recipes/:id`) - Full recipe view
4. **Create Recipe** (`/recipes/new`) - Recipe creation form
5. **Edit Recipe** (`/recipes/:id/edit`) - Recipe editing
6. **Weekly Planner** (`/planner`) - Meal planning interface
7. **Shopping List** (`/shopping`) - Generated grocery list

## üé® Design Priorities

- **Clean & Intuitive**: Easy recipe browsing and selection
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for kitchen use
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized images and smooth interactions
- **Visual Recipe Cards**: Attractive recipe presentation
- **Efficient Workflows**: Minimize clicks from recipe to shopping list

## üöÄ Development Phases

- Recipe CRUD operations
- Basic meal planning
- Shopping list generation
- User authentication

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience

- Recipe import from websites
- Advanced search/filtering
- Recipe collections/tags

## Schema Validation

- [Zod](---)

That's a fantastic question, and it's a critical next step for building a robust and secure API. Implementing a JSON schema validator will add another layer of security and data integrity to your server routes.

For your Nuxt setup, you would typically define and implement the validator in two main places:

### 1\. Defining the Schema

You'd define the JSON Schema itself in a dedicated, shared directory, such as `~/server/schemas` or `~/shared/types/schemas`. Using a validation library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Joi](https://joi.dev/) is the standard approach here.

For example, you could create a file like `~/server/schemas/recipeSchema.ts` and define your schema for a `BaseRecipe`:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

export const recipeSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  // ... all other fields
});
```

### 2\. Implementing the Validator

Once defined, you would implement this schema directly within your Nuxt server routes. The `h3` library that Nuxt's server routes are built on has excellent, built-in helpers for this exact purpose.

Instead of using `readBody()`, you would use `readValidatedBody()`. This function takes the event and your schema as arguments. It will automatically parse the body, validate it against the schema, and throw an `H3Error` if the data is invalid, preventing you from ever processing bad data.

So, in your `/api/recipe/[id].put.ts` file, you would change this line:

```typescript
const updatedRecipeData = await readBody<BaseRecipe>(event);
```

To this:

```typescript
import { readValidatedBody } from 'h3';
import { recipeSchema } from '~/server/schemas/recipeSchema';

const updatedRecipeData = await readValidatedBody(event, recipeSchema);
```

This ensures that the incoming data is always valid and correctly typed before you even attempt to update the database. This is the recommended and standard approach for building type-safe and secure APIs in Nuxt.
